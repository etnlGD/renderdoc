Python API
==========

The python API is accessible via scripting in the QRenderDoc tool. This gives access to both the base replay API that the UI is built on top of, as well as scripting ability for the UI itself and some higher level utility functionality.

It is also possible to build a standalone module of just the base API which can be loaded into python and used for scripting directly without the UI. Due to the inherent difficulty of distributing C python modules this isn't included by default in distributed builds at the time of writing, but is generated by default in source builds - ``renderdoc.pyd`` on windows or ``renderdoc.so`` elsewhere.
